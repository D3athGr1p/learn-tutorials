The previous step left us hanging, since we still have not seen the entry we just created. Let's keep progressing by building an API endpoint to retrieve entries.

# Implementation üß©

We first need to write another endpoint that will fetch a specified entry for our application. We've structured the endpoint at `pages/api/arweave/[transactionHash].ts`, but we still need to write the core functionality.

Thinking about this endpoint, we should be able to pass in an identifier for a transaction and get the transaction data in response. We can do that by leveraging the `getData` method for Arweave transactions and we can parse the JSON it returns:

```typescript
const txDataResp = (await arweave.transactions.getData(
  transactionHash as string,
  {
    decode: true,
    string: true,
  },
)) as string;
const txData = JSON.parse(txDataResp);
```

We should then check whether the transaction has been confirmed before sending a response to the client.

{% sidenote title="Box 4.1: What does it mean for Arweave transactions to confirm?" %}
As with any distributed system, there is a trade off between speed and being decentralized. In order for the data to be stored, the Arweave protocol has to achieve consensus. You can read more about [Arweave's consensus mechanism](https://arweave.medium.com/what-is-arweave-explain-like-im-five-425362144eb5) but suffice it to say that the lag most databases experience when writing data is exacerbated in distributed storage. That lag is amplified by the fact that data is not only being written over a network but agreed upon across the protocol. This currently takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes.

It will become clear why in Step 6 when we associate NFTs with each entry but, as a preview, we wouldn't want users claiming NFTs before an entry is actually created on Arweave.

Also note that you can choose how many confirmations an entry should receive before considering it confirmed. For this template, we have set the required number of confirmations in `constants.ts` through the `MIN_NUMBER_OF_CONFIRMATIONS` environment variable.

```typescript
const txStatusResp = await arweave.transactions.getStatus(
  transactionHash as string,
);

const txStatus =
  txStatusResp.status === 200 &&
  txStatusResp.confirmed &&
  txStatusResp.confirmed.number_of_confirmations >=
    MIN_NUMBER_OF_CONFIRMATIONS
    ? TransactionStatusE.CONFIRMED
    : TransactionStatusE.NOT_CONFIRMED;
```

Once we've confirmed that our data has been written to Arweave, we can get the transaction by using its identifier from the query parameter `transactionHash`. 

```typescript
const tx = await arweave.transactions.get(transactionHash as string);
```

We should also get the tags, so we have access to the user's address:

```typescript
const tags = {} as PostTagsT;
(tx.get('tags') as any).forEach((tag) => {
  const key = tag.get('name', {decode: true, string: true});
  tags[key] = tag.get('value', {decode: true, string: true});
});
```

And we should get the block, so we have access to the entry's timestamp:

```typescript
const block = txStatusResp.confirmed
  ? await arweave.blocks.get(txStatusResp.confirmed.block_indep_hash)
  : null;
```

With that, we have all the building blocks the client will need to display an entry - entry data, author, and timestamp. We can build the response and return it:

```typescript
res.status(200).json({
  id: transactionHash as string,
  data: txData,
  status: txStatus,
  timestamp: block?.timestamp,
  tags,
});
```

"But we still haven't displayed an entry!", you yell. Yes, we absolutely should do that. We'll get to that in Step 5.

Navigate to `pages/api/arweave/[transactionHash].ts` in your editor and follow the steps included as comments to finish writing the endpoint to retrieve entries. We include a description along with a link to the documentation you need to review in order to implement each line. The relevant code block is also included in **Listing 4.2** below.
